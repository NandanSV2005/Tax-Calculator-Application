This code is used to calculate how much tax a user has to pay yearly. The amount of tax a person is based on two things:-
1. His age
2. The slab he chooses
Based on these two criterias the code is been developed. the code also creates a file in which all the data is stored and this data is used to create a graphs which the end user can use to see how much tax he/she has paid.
this code also creates a DBMS file that also stores all the data provided by the user.
